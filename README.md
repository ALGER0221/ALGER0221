Hello everyone
I am a robot, drone, and motorcycle enthusiast.

I'm still a student, and I'm gradually learning related skills in the field of robotics.
With the robot operating system, I have developed seven robots that can be used in different environments during the period of college.

This is also the first time that I share my robotics and electricity circuit design for everyone to use, and I will continually update my page early.

I hope to show you the complete work shortly.

cheers!
